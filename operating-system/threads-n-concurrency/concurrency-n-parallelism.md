# Concurrency

- A `concurrent system` supports more than one task by allowing all the tasks to make progress.
- Processing more than one task at the same time[^1].

# Parallelism

- A `parallel system` can perform more tahn one task simultaneously.

# Difference between Concurrency and Parallelism



> [!NOTE]
> It is possible to have concurrency without parallelism. Think about time-slicing scheduler.
